"""Fail the build on parts that are too crude to be the thing they are named.

Part count is the wrong metric and it is easy to game: splitting one mesh into
sixteen raises the count by fifteen and adds no geometry at all. What matters
is whether each part has the shape it actually has.

The reference is the F110 turbofan in the sibling project: 99 parts at a mean
of 8,642 vertices each, because every blade there is an individually lofted
aerofoil. This engine started at 212 vertices per part, with 24-vertex fuel
rails standing in for thick-walled forgings and a 12-vertex dipstick.

The mean is not directly comparable across the two -- a turbofan is a hundred
big parts and a V8 is four hundred parts of which many are fasteners -- so the
honest number is the total: the F110 is 855k vertices, this engine is 554k.
The gate below is a ratchet. Raise it when the model gets better; never lower
it to make a build pass.

So: every part must clear a vertex floor, unless it is genuinely a flat plate
or a simple fastener, and the whole model must clear a mean. The exemptions
are listed by name rather than inferred, so adding one is a deliberate act
that shows up in a diff.
